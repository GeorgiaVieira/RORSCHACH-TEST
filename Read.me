# ðŸŒ€ Mindpool: A Rorschach Test Invitation

Welcome to **Mindpool**, a space for reflection, perception, and playful depth.  
This project was born from curiosity and a desire to gently explore how we see, interpret, and maybe even misinterpret ourselves.

Itâ€™s inspired by the original Rorschach inkblots and remixed with some mindful use of technology.  
No data collection, no judgment. Just a quiet little ritual between you and what you see.

## ðŸŒ± What is this?

Mindpool is a visual and philosophical invitation.

Youâ€™ll be shown a series of public-domain inkblot images.  
For each one, youâ€™ll choose what you saw first.  
Was it the whole image? The shape? The background? A tiny hidden detail?

Your answers will gently place you on a perceptual map, helping you notice tendencies in how your mind organizes reality:  

**Global vs Detail**  
**Imaginative vs Concrete**

This isnâ€™t a psychological evaluation. Itâ€™s more like a mirror, or a dreamy puddle, to peek into your own image.

## ðŸ§  What does it tell me?

At the end, youâ€™ll get:
- A short interpretation of your perceptual tendencies
- A cute quadrant graph placing you in the Mindpool Map
- A chance to reflect, restart, or simply close the app

Whether you're imaginative and global or detail-focused and grounded, youâ€™re beautifully human. Thatâ€™s the point.

## ðŸ’» How do I run it?

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed
2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already
3. Clone or download this repository
4. Place your inkblot images in a folder called `/images`  
(make sure they are named `1.png` to `10.png`)
5. Run the application


## ðŸ§© Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter (for the interface)
- Pillow (for image handling)
- Matplotlib (for the quadrant graph)

## ðŸŒŠ Why did I build this?

Because self-perception matters.  
Because I love soft technology.  
Because coding can also be poetic.

This was part of my journey into ethical tech, self-knowledge, and emotional design.  
I hope it sparks something meaningful in you too.
